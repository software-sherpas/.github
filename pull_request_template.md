<!--

All NTE System Engineering code reviews are performed via GitHub Pull Requests, written in 
[well-structured (linted) Markdown](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown).

While you can certainly write the contents of your pull-request through the GitHub UI, 
you may want to consider using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) 
along with the extensions mentioned above as it provides strong support for markdown. 
At the time of this writing VS Code is much stronger in this regard than Visual Studio.

All Pull requests correspond to one or more work-items.


## Pre-requistes

While its perfectly fine to start a pull-request to get early feedback for your code, 
the pull request that is intended to be merged into the main branch should comply with the following:

* All testing complete
* Pipeline successfully run with at least a [Credential Scan](https://aka.ms/CredScan)
* Updates to your repo's readme.md are complete
* All markdown files passed lint checks
* All conflicts with the main branch are resolved.


## Commits

Prior to starting your pull request make sure all commits for the request are squashed.


Your commit message format should be:

`<Work Item Number> <Work Item Title>`

For example:

`1244 Auto-N-Checker: Daily Run for all Eligible Programs`

## Pull Request Reviews

Following the first push of comments, expect reviews in the form of github conversations.

Any addressed comment can be marked as resolved if there is no further conversation.

Do not resolve comments that have not been addressed or that have follow-up questions.

### Follow-up Commits

* All follow-up commits should be squashed prior to asking for another review. This means each follow-up review should contain one and only-one commit.

* Do not add additional functionality, code reformatting or any other changes other than those that directly respond to comments. 
If you have more work to do put them in a seperate comment.

### Background (Optional)
Provide a clear description of the high-level effort related to this PR. 
Include the context for others who might not be famaliar or when you need
to look this up in the future. When applicable , link to design documents or high-level tracking
epics here.
-->
### Problem
<!--
Provide a clear description of the problem you are solving. A _brief_ description of the problem. 
This might be a repeat of some information in the work item, but briefly describe the issue/feature 
here so the reviewer does not need to read the work item to get started with the review.
Write in terms of a specificsymptom that affects users or the business. Do not include the solution. 
-->
<!--
### Evaluation
If the cause of the problem is not obvious, provide a root-cause
analysis (RCA).
-->
### Solution
<!--
Provide a clear description of the solution you have chosen.
If there were other possible solutions that you considered and rejected,
mention those along with the corresponding reasoning. Do not describe
implementation details when writing about the solution; these should go
into the implementation section instead.
-->
### Testing Done
<!--
Provide a clear description of how this change was tested. At minimum
this should include proof that a computer has executed the changed
lines. Ideally this should include an automated test or an explanation
as to why this pull request has no tests.
-->
<!--
### Implementation (Optional)
Describe the implementation details of the solution. Generally the
reasoning behind any non-obvious code should be recorded in code
comments. However, code comments should always describe the current
state of the code; in contrast, this section may be useful to describe
the relationship between the original code and the code being proposed
in this pull request.
-->
<!--
### Notes to Reviewers
Provide any extra information a reviewer may need to know before
evaluating your pull request. For example, you may wish to describe
which files should be reviewed first or which files are auto-generated.
If the review tool cannot detect a file move, you may wish to link to a
patch comparing the old file and the new file.
-->
<!--
### Deployment Plan
Describe how the code in this pull request will be deployed. Some
deployments are complicated and may require flag days between multiple
repositories or the provisioning of new infrastructure. Describing your
deployment plan allows reviewers to ensure that your work will not cause
any unnecessary interruption to end users.

<!--
### Future Work
Provide a description of any possible follow-up work that is explicitly
not being done in this pull request.
